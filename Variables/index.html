  <h1>Variables</h1>
  The web-app "Variables" allows students to tinker with the basic concepts of variables, datatypes, operations
  and literals. It creates TypeScript code from the interactions which should be copied, tested and further modified.
  <p>Color codes:
  <ul>
    <li>red = select type or operator</li>
    <li>blue = drag from</li>
    <li>green = drop on</li>
  </ul>
  On mobile, a long press starts drag. Firefox on Android does not support drag & drop...</p>
  To start the application without any preset, click here: <a href="Variables.html">Core Application</a>

  <h2>Tasks</h2>
  Click on the link for each task to start the app with the appropriate preset. Copy the generated code to a
  TypeScript project in VSCode, compile and test. Tinker with the values and the types. At the end of each task, discuss
  your
  insights in the group and record them.
  <ol>
    <li><a href="Variables.html">Operations with literal values</a><br />
      Type a literal and drag it to the left side of the operation, drag another one to the right. Play around with all
      operators and all combination of datatypes. How can you actually produce different data types as literals?.
      Exception: In this task, no code gets generated.
    </li>
    <li><a href="Variables.html">Declare and define variables</a><br />
      Declare and define variables with different names and types. Drop literals on to the value fields of the
      variables. Explain the difference between declaration and definition.</li>
    <li><a href="Variables.html">Variables and operations</a><br />
      Use variables to feed the operation. Drop the result into the value field of a variable and watch the generated
      code.</li>
    <li><a href="Variables.html?w,number,5|h,number,3">Calculate Area</a><br />
      Create a program, that uses a new variable a, to hold the size of the area of the rectangle with the width w and
      the heigt h. The algorithm created should work with any numerical values for w and h, do not create additional
      literals.
    </li>
    <li><a href="Variables.html?t,string,Oh%20no!%20">Oh no!</a><br />
      Create a program of only three lines of code (including the line it starts with), that produces "Oh no! Oh no! Oh
      no! Oh no! " as the value of variable t. Do not create additional literals or variables.
    </li>
    <li><a href="Variables.html?x,number,1|y,number,2">Swap Values</a><br />
      Swap the values of the variables x and y, without creating additional literals. No operations needed
    </li>
  </ol>
